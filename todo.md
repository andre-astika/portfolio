- [ ] Inspect the Lumora reference hero background and identify reusable visual behaviors.
- [x] Keep the existing hero typography, controls, copy, and layout unchanged, except remove the hero portrait element.
- [x] Replace or layer only the hero background with a Lumora-inspired monochrome treatment.
- [x] Copy and upload the newly attached 16:9 plain and Weekend photos as durable web assets.
- [x] Use the newly attached plain 16:9 photo as the Hero background by default and crossfade to the newly attached cap-and-glasses 16:9 photo when hovering the Hero.
- [x] Keep the reference-style background interaction visibly tied to the Hero hover area, not only to a hidden image element.
- [x] Keep the reusable portrait hover behavior available in the About/Experience section after removing the hero portrait.
- [x] Verify desktop layout, mobile layout, actual hover crossfade, and TypeScript; confirm no browser-console errors.
- [x] Rebuild the Hero interaction as a pointer-following soft brush reveal instead of a binary crossfade.
- [x] Add a cursor ring and spring-like pointer smoothing while keeping the base photo visible.

## Corrected Lumora mechanics

The supplied Lumora prompt describes the Hero as a full-bleed before/after photo with a “liquid cursor-reveal.” It uses two full-screen image layers: the base image remains visible, while a second image is revealed only inside a soft circular brush around the pointer. The pointer position is normalized to the Hero bounds, the reveal follows the pointer with spring-like easing, and the brush has a feathered edge rather than a hard clip. The interaction is therefore a moving mask/reveal, not a binary whole-background image swap. The prompt also calls for a small circular cursor indicator over the reveal point and for the effect to be disabled on touch/reduced-motion contexts.

## Reference findings

The Lumora hero uses a calm, cinematic background rather than a busy graphic: a pale smoky field, a large monochrome focal image, soft translucent horizontal light bands, blurred orb-like gradients, and a very large low-contrast wordmark/image texture behind the foreground copy. The composition feels editorial and atmospheric, with the content layered above the background. For Andre, retain the existing black/grayscale Noir Kinetic palette and typography; borrow only the background behavior by making the existing fluid layer calmer, more cinematic, and softly luminous. Keep the existing hero copy, mode switch, CTA, portrait placement, and nav unchanged.
